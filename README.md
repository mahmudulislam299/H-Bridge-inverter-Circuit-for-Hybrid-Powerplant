# H-Bridge-inverter-Circuit-for-Hybrid-Powerplant
This project aims is to design and construct a quite simple, efficient and low cost inverter with
high output capabilities to power some selected domestic appliances such lighting system,
small fan.
Our projects consists of three parts.
1) Converting and storing solar energy into a dc battery
2) Converting the stored dc into ac in the output side
3) Using this ac output to drive up to 30 watt ac load
